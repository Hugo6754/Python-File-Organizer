# Python File Organizer

This script helps keep your folders tidy by automatically sorting all files in a directory into categorized subfolders based on their file type (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .zip).

This project was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my practical Python skills for the BBD Bursary & Beyond Programme.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Download the `Organizer.py` script.
2.  **Place Script:** Move the `Organizer.py` file into the folder you want to organize (for example, your "Downloads" folder).
3.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to that folder, and run the script using the command:
    ```
    python Organizer.py
    ```
4.  The script will then create the necessary subfolders and move the files accordingly.

## Technologies Used
*   Python
*   OS Module (for interacting with the operating system)
*   Shutil Module (for file operations like moving files)
